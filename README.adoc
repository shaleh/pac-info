= PAC Info Tool

Simple tools that use a PAC footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config] file to determine what the proper proxy is for a given URL.

To begin run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will ensure the needed libraries are installed.
Then you can copy the scripts to some place in your `PATH` or just run them from the checkout. Don't forget to ensure they are `chmod +x`.

pac-info will retrieve the PAC file and tell you the PROXY used for a given domain. This is useful for setting up NO_PROXY for example.
You can use a tool like wget to retrieve the PAC file from the autocache site and use `--pac-file` instead of downloading the file each time.

```
$ pac-info --pac-url http://PROXY_AUTOCACHE google.com
$ pac-info --pac-url http://PROXY_AUTOCACHE some.internalsite.example.com  # should be DIRECT and belongs in NO_PROXY
```

gen-proxy-env will output the needed proxy settings in a format ready for /etc/environment. It too can use `--pac-file`.

Example how to use it:

```
$ gen-proxy-env --pac-url http://PROXY_AUTOCACHE google.com
```
